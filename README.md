# UE4MachineLearning
A Unreal Engine 4 C++ Based Machine Learning Libary

The Basic Neural Network is based on the work done by Dave Miller over at http://www.millermattson.com/dave/ but using all UE4 code where possible. I was going to include my rewritten ue4 based math functions but the std math libs outperform. I was also going to sell this orginally and asked Dave if it was alright and he said it was fine. But ultimatley i disliked the marketplace ToS. So it's free of charge to anyone with the MIT licence. Enjoy.
