# UE4MachineLearning
A Unreal Engine 4 C++ Based Machine Learning Libary

The Basic Neural Network was based on the work done by Dave Miller.  Over at http://www.millermattson.com/dave/ and more specifically http://www.millermattson.com/dave/?p=54 but using all UE4 code where possible. I was going to include my rewritten ue4 based math functions too, but the std math libs outperform. I was also going to sell this originally and asked Dave if it was alright and he said it was fine. But ultimately, i disliked the marketplace ToS. So it's free of charge to anyone with the MIT licence. Enjoy.

I am expanding this plugin to include genetic neural network functionality. Which can be looked at in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtsJf0ottIw
